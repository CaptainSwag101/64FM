'Hello.
'Welcome to 64FM. (Formerly SM64FM.)
'It was started in 2014 under the same name, but with a whole different UI and Icon.
'Both based in what was Source Filmmaker. (The name stays!)
'The old icon and a screenshot from the old interface can be found laying there in the resources.
'This was the second thing I did when I learnt Visual Basic in a weekend.
'While I was coding this one, I was learning more... and more looking at another code examples.
'This was always the thing I was doing when I always said to my mom: "I'm programming"...
'The first thing I coded was a simple Windows Forms Application, that was based in a WebBrowser with many buttons.
'It was a IM for my school, tho it has never been used and it's still in my PC.
'This is my second, and my longest project in code, and that means this code, in its enterity, is my biggest achievement in my 
'computer life since the installation of Windows 10 in a PC with an Intel Atom Processor... Heh.
'This code means too much to me.
'If somehow I lose it, My.Resources.Heart would be actually... broken.
'This code will give me nostalgia sometimes because as I'm writing this, and the more code 
'I write, more things in my life happen, and they are grateful.
'I hope the best for this program.
'and I hope I, and other developers help the whole SM64 Community, aswell other ... "mateys".
'If you are reading this, you are a developer. Just by the fact I have enough trust in you,
'to lend ya my code, means you're a really good person, or I saw something very nice in you.
'Hold up just a second, I put this in Github! Means I have trust in everyone who has this code! :P
'LOL, doesn't matter a lot actually--
'Thanks for reading this, and now let's begin.
'Borderstar 2014-2016.

'About time.
