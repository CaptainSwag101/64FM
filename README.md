(formerly Super Mario 64 Filmmaker)
Started by GlitchyPSI in 27 December, 2014. Maintained by James "CaptainSwag101" Pelster and GlitchyPSI.

Focused as a program to help newbies, amateurs and "what not" users to SM64 Machinima making.

No stable release.
All the releases here are obsolete, won't be supported ever.

Maybe one day. *I'm not sure.*
